						Being told you're B2 or C1 doesn't always mean you feel confident speaking English. CEFR levels are useful, but they don't show the full picture of real communication.

						What CEFR Actually Measures
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						This blog post examines the limitations of CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) levels in assessing practical English communication abilities.
					</p>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						The article addresses a common disconnect: many learners receive B2 or C1 certifications yet still struggle with conversational fluency. Leonard explains that CEFR measures specific competencies—"vocabulary range, grammar knowledge and performance in structured tasks"—but these don't necessarily translate to real-world communication confidence.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12" style="color: var(--color-primary)">
						What CEFR Doesn't Capture
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						The post distinguishes between what CEFR actually evaluates and what it overlooks. While the framework provides standardized benchmarks through "Can Do" statements describing learner capabilities, it captures formal language ability without fully accounting for factors like spontaneous speaking anxiety, cultural communication nuances, or practical fluency in authentic conversations.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12" style="color: var(--color-primary)">
						Implications for Learners
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						Understanding this distinction helps learners establish realistic expectations when pursuing English proficiency. The author suggests that CEFR certification alone doesn't guarantee conversational comfort, and learners may benefit from supplementary instruction targeting communication skills beyond test preparation.
					</p>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						The piece implies that different lesson types serve different purposes—standardized frameworks measure one dimension of language mastery while overlooking others equally important for functional communication ability.
