						Many English learners understand far more than they can comfortably say. The reason speaking feels harder lies in how the brain processes language and how English is usually learned.

						Speaking Demands Active Production
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						The article distinguishes between receptive skills (reading and listening) and productive ones (speaking). Speaking requires simultaneously "choosing the right words, organizing grammar in real time, pronouncing clearly, and responding appropriately to the situation."
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12" style="color: var(--color-primary)">
						Time Pressure Increases Difficulty
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						Unlike reading or listening where learners can pause or review, "speaking doesn't allow that luxury. You must respond immediately, even if you're unsure." This absence of preparation time contributes significantly to the perceived difficulty gap.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12" style="color: var(--color-primary)">
						Anxiety Around Mistakes
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						The post addresses psychological barriers, suggesting fear of errors creates hesitation in spontaneous conversation, even among learners with solid grammatical knowledge.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12" style="color: var(--color-primary)">
						Broader Insight
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
						The piece normalizes this experience as common among language learners rather than indicative of poor ability, suggesting the challenge reflects fundamental differences in skill types rather than individual competence.
